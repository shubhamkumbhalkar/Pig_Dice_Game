Hello friends, 

Thanks for visiting my profile. 

I have built the Pig(Dice game) which is fun to play using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Rules are pretty simple and can be found here:

I have just modified it with a simple alert msg where you can put the winning score before the game starts.

So, lets jump to play the game. Happy playing!!
